       1      15 ounce  pa  all-ready piecrusts
       1         large  egg yolk

     1/4           cup  all-purpose flour
      10        ounces  frozen peas

 In deep 12" skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil; add celery, carrots, onion and potatoes; cook 15 minutes, stirring occasionally until vegetables are lightly browned.  Add garlic; cook 1 minute.  Stir in chicken broth.  Reduce heat to low; simmer, covered, 25 minutes until vegetables are tender.

 Meanwhile, heat oven to 425 degrees; have ready four 8" oval gratin dishes.

 If using homemade pastry, roll out on lightly floured surface to 1/8" thickness; or unfold all-ready piecrusts.  Using bottom of one gratin dish as pattern, cut out 1 "lids"; cut out small hole in center of each and several slits as vents for steam.  Arrange on ungreased large cookie sheet; brush with egg-yolk mixture (1 egg yolk and 1 Tbsp. water).  Bake 10 to 12 minutes until lightly browned.

 In small saucepan over medium heat, melt butter; add flour; stir until smooth.  Cook 2 minutes, stirring frequently; remove from heat.  Stir mixture gradually into vegetables simmering in skillet; cook 2 to 3 minutes longer, stirring occasionally until thickened.  Stir in peas and turkey; remove from heat.

 Spoon mixture into gratin dishes, dividing evenly.  Place pastry lid on top of each; bake 5 to 10 minutes until filling is heated through.
